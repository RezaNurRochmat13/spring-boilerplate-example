## 🧱 Project Architecture

```
src/
├── presenter/   # Controllers or REST API layer
├── service/     # Business logic layer
├── repository/  # Data access layer (Spring Data JPA)
├── entity/      # JPA Entities
└── config/      # Configuration classes (e.g., DB, CORS, Security)
```

This structure follows a layered architecture and is designed for easy maintainability and testing.
